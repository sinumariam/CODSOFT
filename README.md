# CODSOFT--Machine Learning Internship
This Repository contains the projects I completed during my Machine Learning Internship with CODSOFT

### Tasks
### Task 1. MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION

  Problem Statement:
* Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.
* Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.
* Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb


### Task 2.CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION 

  Problem Statement:
* Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions
* Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,or Random Forests to classify 
  transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

### Task 3.SPAM SMS DETECTION

  Problem Statement:
* Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.
* Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings withclassifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages
